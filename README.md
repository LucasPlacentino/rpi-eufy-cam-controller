# rpi-eufy-cam-controller ⚠️This is a WIP🏗️
RaspberryPi controller for Eufy Cameras: enable/disable cameras, detection, etc

Runs alongside [bropat/eufy-security-ws](https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-ws) [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/bropat/eufy-security-ws) (which is automatically started).

<!--### For the ESP32 version, look [here](https://github.com/LucasPlacentino/esp-eufy-cam-controller).-->

### 💖 This wouldn't be possible without [bropat/eufy-security-client](https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-client/), all credit for the reverse-engineered API is thanks to his project and its contributors.
